This is the repository contains all the code, figures and reports, related to the Data Science Project Competition 2024. 


## About the Project ##

The motivation for optimizing energy usage lies in the need
for sustainability, efficiency, and reliability in the energy infrastructure to mitigate climate change and ensure a brighter, greener future. The focus of this project relates to a power grid, which connects electric vehicle charging stations to three different power sources â€“ solar panels, batteries and the public electric grid. Due to limitations of the grid and variable nature of solar power, a system was put in place by Siemens that governs the behavior of the grid and distributes power according to momentary supply and demand.

However, the almost black box nature of the decision system makes it difficult to further improve and optimize its decision making process. Our goal for this project therefore, is to explain the decision-making process that governs the behavior of the grid. We approach the task by first trying to recover the governing rules from the dataset provided by Siemens. We establish baseline model with which we try to recover the provided ground truths. Next, we look to further expand upon those rules, utilizing neuro-symbolic approaches. Finally, we look for ways to optimize the behavior of the grid via threshold optimization.

## Repository Structure ##

All of the code that was used to generate results, referenced in the report, can be found in the `Code.ipynb` python notebook. All figures can be found in the `Figures/` folder. All of thme were generated with the code, provided in the notebook, however, some were additionally enhanced using 3rd party software. Interim and final report can be found in corresponding folders. Folder `journal/` contains loggs of individual contributions.

## Reproducibility ##

Code, provided in the `Code.ipynb` is compatible with Python==3.12. In order to recreate the conda environment, the following commands can be run from the root directory of the repository:

`
conda env create -f environment.yml
`

In order to activate the environment, run the following command:

`
conda activate Project
